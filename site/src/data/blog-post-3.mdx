### A Designer's Legacy

Willem Hendrik Crouwel is one of the greatest graphic designers worldwide. He studied at the Academie Minerva (Art School) in Groningen. After two years spent collaborating with the prominent Dutch painter and designer Dick Elffers (1910-1990), he attended the evening classes at the IvKNO—Instituut voor Kunstnijverheidsonderwijs (Institute for Craftsmanship Education) in Amsterdam, today known as the Rietveld Academy.

> A designer of the future has to have a strong training in systems and in consistent thinking. Furthermore, in my opinion they must be aware of the basic laws inherit in nature and science.

Crouwel taught during his whole career. In the 1950s he gave a design course at the Royal Academy of Art and Design (AKV) in ’s-Hertogenbosch. In 1965 he gave a typography course at the Delft University, where in 1972 he was appointed Associate Professor. In 1980 he became a full Professor and in 1985 he was appointed Dean of the Faculty. At the same time, he was appointed Director of the Boijmans van Beuningen Museum in Rotterdam, holding this position until his retirement in 1993. From 1987 to 1993 he also taught at the EUR (Erasmus University in Rotterdam).

### Notable Designs

Wim Crouwel is a virtuoso of experimentation, who both lived and anticipated his own time. He combined rigorous structural logics with meaningful expressiveness, showing an extraordinary mastery in color and typography, making letters becoming wonderful images. He produced many of the few masterpieces that perfectly match functionality with aesthetics, and could be truly considered great works of both art and graphic design.
