### A Designer's Legacy

Otl Aicher was an eminent German graphic designer and typographer. His most notable works include the pictograms that he designed for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. His use of stick figures for public signage had an influential effect on graphic designing. Besides, he was also the co-founder of the Ulm School of Design.

Furthermore, Aicher also had a keen interest in corporate branding. He was requested to design the logo for German airline, Lufthansa which came out in 1969. Besides that, he was approached by the organizers of the 1972 Summer Olympics, offering him the Olympic Games’ lead designer’s position. The instruction he received from the organizers included that the design must complement the architecture of the newly built stadium in Munich. For consultation, Aicher approached Masaru Katsumi, who designed for the previous 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games. Reviewing the ’64 Games design, he based his work partly on previously employed iconography and created a set of pictograms.

### Notable Work

These pictograms were developed with the intention of presenting a visual interpretation of the sport the stadium featured. This careful creation of pictograms helped athletes and visitors find their way around the Olympic village and stadium. He made use of Univers typeface for the Olympic designs. In fact, Aicher’s technique of representation through design was adopted by the United States Department of Transportation as they developed the DOT pictograms in 1974. Soon those signage were used publically around the globe, for instance for toilets and telephones. Moreover, he is credited for creating the Munich Olympics logo and the first official Olympic Mascot, a dachshund.
